RAGNAR;Travis Fimmel;Ragnar Lothbrok is a restless warrior and family man who longs to find and explore new countries across the sea. His goal is to settle his own people to thrive on rich new farm lands. Now that he is King, his ambition to raid new kingdoms remains unquenchable, not least because he claims to be an ancestor of the Norse god Odin–the god of slain warriors, but also the god of eternal curiosity.;https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/cdn.watch.aetnd.com/sites/2/2016/10/vikings_season4_cast_ragnar_16_9.jpg?w=840;https://www.history.com/shows/vikings/cast/ragnar
LAGERTHA;Katheryn Winnick;Lagertha is the first wife of Ragnar Lothbrok. She is an Earl, a strong shield-maiden and a force to be reckoned with.

ASTRID;Josefin Asplund;Astrid is a beautiful young woman who has joined Lagertha’s court at Hedeby.
